    - Take a long rest in the Tiny Hut
    - Make it to Zymorgan Hall, is a little village with a keep/castle in the center
        - Walls are closed up, but we haven't been shot at yet
        - Knock on doors, nothing happens
        - Push on the gate and it opens
        - At stable, stablekeeper says Lord Harthos Zymorgan is the only real warrior in this town, he owns/runs the town?
            - Also says Gertrude runs the inn
    - Center of Zymorgan Hall is similarly laid out to Tribor, group heads there and enters
        - No guards/people in sight
        - Old swords on the walls, dusty carpets, suits of armor, etc
        - Oberon detects a faint amount of magic on the armor & sword - seems vaguely familiar
            - The swords have the same magic as the flying swords in Nightstone
        - Dagon writes a note saying "find us at the inn", and drops it on to a suit of armor
        - We hear clinking and turn to see 6 flying swords and 2 suits of armor (more in the background) in motion
        - 3 Carpets jump up and try to grapple Dagon but they all fail
        - Hear footsteps and then "WHO GOES THERE??" (it's the Lord)
            - Oberon talks it out, the Lord knows of Urgula, Oberon also tells him about Harshnag and the Giant Slayer Greataxe
            - Lord Zymorgan disables the trap and we all sit down for some chit-chat
            - Lord Zymorgan' son took the axe and left, ran off with a common thief
            - Says the thief was in Yatar (next to Tribor) with a thief (3 days walk)
