# DND day 31
Attendees: Carlor, Dagon, Oberon

- (continued after battle with Hill Giants which attacked at night on the journey to Silverymoon - multiple true deaths and a giant named Harshnag)
    - We give Harshnag the low-down on pretty much our entire journey so far
    - He says since his adventuring party disbanded (Force Grey), he roams the earth purging evil (mostly evil giants)
        - When the ordening was in place, Giants were OK, but since it ended Giants have been the worst
    - Take a long rest
- Next day
    - Harshnag joins the group to help reestablish the ordening
    - Make it near Silverymoon within 1/2 a day of walking
    - Harshnag peaces out when we get close, says he'll rejoin us when we leave the city
    - Town is beautiful and very foresty
    - Carlor recalls having travelled to Silverymoon with his father, it was a place known for its beauty as well as its libraries and breathtaking temples/shrines
        - Also recalls that though it used to be a nice town in the North, the reputation was recently tarnished during the war of the silver marches, where Sunderbar was screwed over 8 years ago (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/War_of_the_Silver_Marches)
    - We walk up to a temple, Carlor, Harix & Oberon go in, Dagon flies around the town instead
    - Inside the temple
        - Oberon offers a prayer to the goddess
        - Leave to find Dagon
    - Arrive to the center area of the town, on the far side see Dagon wandering around, taking a bird bath in the pond
    - Dagon found a nice inn for the group, costs 10gp each (40gp)
