# DND day 4
Attendees: Carlor, Dagon, Harix, Oberon, Thor

* Notes: We used Techno for a few tasks despite him not being here
* Edits to combat:
    * Protection
        * Works even if you are leaving, as long as your started near the shield man
        * Only once per turn (shield bearer decides when)
        * Only blocks one attack (so a multi-attack will only be affected on the first attack)
    * Grappling
        * Can still attack when grappled
    * Short & long rests
        * When you take a short rest, if you use a hit die, it is expended (can't be used on the next short rest)
        * When you take a long rest, you only get half of your hit die back
